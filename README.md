# Motivation
When I think about it, my selected topic has been something I’ve always been interested in based on the many conversations my sister and I would have over the years. As a native New Yorker, I’ve been fortunate to experience the world-renowned culinary scene the city has to offer. No matter what culture it is, if you want to experience it, you can find it in New York.  Although New York has plenty of options for food when it comes to eating out, can we say the same when it comes to buying your own food to cook? Do we have enough grocery stores around the city to meet the demand of a population of almost 9 million people? Out of the all the grocery stores located in the city, how many of them can we say sell healthy/quality food? Is the food even affordable for everyone?

# Proposed Question
What areas of New York City have the best and/or most options when it comes to buying healthy and fresh foods?
* Are there specific boroughs and/or community districts that have significantly better options than others?
* Are the locations of the better food options benefiting certain demographics more than others?
* For community districts that don't have access to the healthy food stores, what type of restaurants are located in the area?
* * What’s the average health inspection grade for restaurants in those districts?
* Where does the location of SNAP Centers in NYC compare to the better food options in terms of community districts?
* * Note: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal program that provides food-purchasing assistance for low-and-no income people.
* For communities districts that don't have access to healthy stores, what type of restaurants are located in the area?
* * What's the average health inspection grade for restaurants in these districts?

# Hypothesis
I predict the that Brooklyn will be the borough with the most access to healthy food  and the areas of NYC that will have the most access to healthy food will be the communities that are in the most affluent neighborhoods of the city located in Midtown and Lower Manhattan (Adjacent and below Central Park) as well as certain parts of Brooklyn (Between Prospect Park and the East River).

# Calculations
For this project, areas that have the best access to healthy foods will be the ones that have the highest combinations of farmers markets, recognized shop healthy stores, and SNAP centers.

The same formula will be used to determine which borough has the best access to healthy foods.

# Conclusion

[NYC Healthy Food Access Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lance.roller/viz/NYC_Healthy_Food_Access/NYCHealthyFoodAccess?publish=yes)

* The Bronx with a slight edge over Brooklyn is the borough with the best and/or most options when it comes to buying healthy and fresh foods.
* Community Districts 111, 205, 206, 305, & 316 are the community districts that have the best options.
* * Part of this is due to the fact that the city government is having success getting underserved communities access to better food with the Shop Healthy NYC program. 
* The majority of SNAP centers were not in close proximity to recognized healthy shops.
* When it comes to demographics, the top community districts had more black, hispanic, and foreign born residents compared to the bottom districts which were more diverse. As previously stated, these results are most likely due to the city government having success getting underserved communities access to better food with the Shop Healthy NYC program. 
* When it comes to health inspection grades, types of violations, and cuisine, there were no significant differences in restaurants located in the top community districts and those at the bottom (The average healthy inspection grade for these districts was an A which is very good).

# Further Investigation
* Are people actually buying healthy foods if they have access to them?

* Sustainability
* * How many Recognized Healthy Shops are maintaining the changes/standard once they’ve received the award?
* * * If customers aren’t buying the healthy foods, how long will it be till owners of these stores stop selling those products and revert to what sells?
* Comparing food expenses by community districts
* Impact of gentrification on food access within the city
* Unreported farmers markets, healthy stores, and SNAP centers
